Deduct 1 mark for incorrect use of notation, but don't penalize them twice for the same error.   

Q1: 9 marks
Defining the predicate : 1 mark
Base case: 1 mark
Stating and labeling the IH: 2 marks (deduct one mark if they didn't lable IH)
Proper use of IH in the IS: 2 marks (deduct one mark if they didn't explicitly mention IH)
Details in the IS: 3 marks (deduct 1 mark for each incorrect or missing step, or if they failed to provide proper justification). 

Q2: 11 marks
Defining the predicate : 1 mark
Base cases: 2 marks, one for each case
Stating and labeling the IH: 3 marks (1 mark for including k > = 1, 2 marks for the rest)
Proper use of IH for x + 1/x and x^k + 1/x^k: 3 marks (deduct one mark if they didn't explicitly mention IH)
Proper use of IH for x^{k-1} + 1/x^{k-1}: 2 marks (deduct one mark if they didn't mention that 1\leq k-1\leq K)

deduct 1 mark for each incorrect or missing step, or if they failed to provide proper justification.
