\section{Quantum Computing}
\subsection{Qubit}
Let $\QA$ measures 0 and $\QB$ measures 1. You should think of each state as an energy level of the electron. However, in reality these states are continuous |rather than discrete. Consider a superposition of $\QA$ and $\QB$. We model quantum mechanics as $\alpha \cdot \QA + \beta \cdot \QB$ where $\alpha, \beta \in \C$ such that $|\alpha |^2 + |\beta |^2$. When we measure the qubit, the duality collapses and we just get classical bits with probability:
\[\begin{cases}
0 &\mbox{ with probability } |\alpha |^2 \\
1 &\mbox{ with probability } |\beta |^2. 
\end{cases}\]
Observe that $\alpha, \beta$ are \emph{not} the probabilities, but their squares \emph{are}. Thus even though the probabilities are non-negative, the actual values $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex (and can be negative).

\subsection{Quantum Registers}
For $m$ qubits, we can describe a quantum register as
\[\sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^m} \alpha_x \cdot x\]S
where $\alpha_x$ is the amplitude of bit string $x$ and $ \sum |\alpha_x |^2$. Observe that for $m$ qubits, the quantum system can be described by a vector in $\C^{2^m}$ (since the coefficient of each $\alpha_x$ is one variable). This gets exceedingly big exceedingly fast.

\subsection{Quantum Operations}
First let us describe the operation $F$ on the quantum system equivalent to negation on the classical bits. As it turns out that these operations $F$ are exactly unary matrices. Generally, it is too much to define $F$ for a quantum system with $m$ qubits even if $m$ is modest. Thus we must restrict the number of qubits we operate upon at one time. For us, each operation will be applied to at most three qubits. Thus $F$ will be a $2^3 \times 2^3$ or $8 \times 8$ matrix. It is unclear if each operator $F$ is realizable.

For bits $\QA$ and $\QB$ observe that  

\subsection{Complexity $\BQP$}
\begin{definition}
Let $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$
\end{definition}

Consider next the $\land$ operation. Classically, we have $x, y \in \{0,1\}$ such that $\AND(x,y) = x \land y$. In quantum computation we need the Trefoli gate which takes in three qubits $x,y,z$ and outputs $\AND(x,y,z) = (x, y, z \oplus (x\land y))$. Observe that the this operation preserves data, in the sense that we can reverse the steps to get back out input. This is a property of the matrices we are using. 

Finally we have use of the operation $\CNOT$ such that $\CNOT(x, y) = (x, x \oplus y)$. Observe, that in essence we, sort of, \emph{copy} the first quantum register into the second (note: this is only cloning for classical bits; in fact it is impossible to clone quantum bits}.  

\begin{theorem}
It is impossible to copy a quantum bit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose for a contradiction that it was possible to copy quantum bits. We will demonstrate a communications system between Alice and Bob with travels faster than the
