\section{Randomness and Interaction}
Today we will show that $\BPP \subseteq \MA \subseteq \AM \subseteq \prod_2^p$. Remark that the first $\subseteq$ is actually quite straight forward. Please consider what $\BPP$ and $\MA$ and explain why. Remark the verifier Arthur check $R(x,y,z)$ where $x$ is the input, $y$ is the value the Merlin sends over, and $z$ is the random string.

As before, we can decrease the error probability by trying $k$ times and taking the majority. Let us do the analysis (use Chernoff bound):
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x \in L$: Let the indicator random variable be $X_1, ..., X_k$ where $X_i = 1 $ if A accepts $R(x,y,z)$ and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. Let us calculate the probability that fewer than $k/n$ variables accept:

Thus this probability is quite low, proportional to exponential decay in $k$.
\item $x \notin L$: $\forall y \forall 1 \leq i \leq k, \Pr_{z_i}[R(x,y,z_i) = 1]$ 
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Note: } what does the Chernoff bound actually say? 
 
In our original protocol, Arthur uses $m$ bits of randomness and gets reasonable error. However, if we use the above then we can reduced the error to $\porp 2^}-k
 $ by using $k\cdot m$ bits of randomness. 

\begin{theorem}
$\MA \subseteq \AM$.
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof}
Let us think about this intuitively: in $\AM$, Merlin is allowed more opportunities to cheat since Merlin sees Arthur's random string.

So let us think about a language $L \in \MA$ and reduce this to a language in $AM$. So we are given some Arthur and Merlin 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Logic of $\MA$ and $\AM$}
Consider the quantifiers
\begin{align*}
\exists 	&\qquad \exists \circ \P = \NP \\
\forall 	&\qquad \forall \circ \P = \coNP \\
\Maj_{2/3}	&\qquad \BP \circ \P = \BPP
\end{align*}

Let us use these as follows. Consider $AM$: here the majority machine goes first then a non-deterministic machine goes. This can be translated into $\BP \circ \exists \circ \P$. Similarly for $MA$, we can write 


Using the above conversions and the above laws we can make quick work of the following theorems.
\begin{theorem}
$\AM \subseteq \prod_2^p$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$MA \subseteq \prod_2^p \cap \sigma_2^p$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Graph Non-isomorphism $\in \AM$}
Recall the Graph Non-isomorphism. First it is important to remark that the Graph Non-isomorphism problem is a private key protocol, that is the randomness chosen by Arthur is not reveal to Merlin. However we will show that this can be made into a public key protocol ($\in \AM$).

\emph{Note:} (in terms of graphs) remark that there is a difference between an automorphism and an isomorphism.

\emph{Note:} (regarding hash functions) $H = \{h\}$ where $h: U \rightarrow M$, for universe $U$ and $M \subset U$, is a random function family if 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Uniform:] $\forall u \in U, \forall a \in M, \Pr_h[h(u) = a] = 1/|M|$.
\item[2-wise Independent:] $\forall u, u' \in U, u \neq u', \Pr_h[h(u) = h(u') = a] = 1/|M|^2$.
\end{enumerate}   

Lets consider an example hash function. 
\begin{example}

\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
$\NISO \in \AM$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We will first solve this problem with certain assumption (not true). Suppose that we have two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ which do not have nontrivial automorphisms. Construct the set $W = \{\}$
\end{proof}
