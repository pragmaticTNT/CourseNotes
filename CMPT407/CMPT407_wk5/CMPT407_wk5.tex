\section{Review}
\begin{theorem}
$\EXP \subset \PolySize \implies \EXP = \Sigma^p_2$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For all $L$ in $\EXP$ there exists a TM $M$, which runs in time $2^{n^c} = t$ for an input $x$ of size $n$. Imagine a $t x t$ grid which describes the operation of $M$. Where each row is a configuration of $M$. This transcript is valid if and only if all windows (three consecutive cells in row $i$ and the associated cell in row $i+1$) are consistent. Consider the function $T: [t] \times [t] \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ where $T(i, j) = \mbox{ cell } j \mbox{ at time } i$. Since we assumed $\EXP \subset \PolySize$ all we need to do is show that $T \in \EXP$. Well, that's pretty obvious, simply execute the TM $M$. Now show that $T \in \Sigma_2$ as follows: $\exists C \forall i,j:$ window $(i, j)$ (in the tableau) is consistent and the tableau ends in an accepting state. 
\end{proof}

\emph{Note: } (by IKW) it is possible to generalize this implication for $\NEXP$, namely $\NEXP \subset \PolySize \implies \NEXP = \Sigma_2$. Proving this is quite a bit more difficult and requires more tool. 

\section{Circuits} 
Let us consider the set of inclusion of circuit complexity: $\mathsf{AC}_0 \subset \mathsf{TC}_0 \subset \mathsf{NC}_1 \subset \PolySize$

\begin{claim}
$\NC_1 = \PolySize$ formula.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
$\NC_1 \subseteq \PolySize$ formula is the easy direction. Now lets attempt to show th other direction, $\PolySize \mbox{ formula } \subseteq \NEXP$. Now a normal expansion of a formula $F$ in $x_1, ..., x_n$ might be of depth $O(n)$. But if you think about it you realize that there are not a lot of "stuff" so a long path can be restructured to be made shorter and wider. In particular cut $F$ into two pieces $F_1$ and $F_2$ each of depth approximately half. Let $f(F)$ be the formula associated the the circuit of $F$. Then  
\end{proof}

\subsection{Valiant's Challenge}
Find an explicit function $f: \{0,1\}^{n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that cannot be computed by a circuit of size $O(n)$ and depth $O(\log n)$.

\begin{definition}
A majority gate is defined as follows: $\mbox{maj}_n: \{\}$
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Let $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ be $n$, $n$ digit numbers. We want to show that this problem in the domain of Valiant's Challenge. So we need to demonstrate a $O(\log n)$ circuit of $O(n)$ size to solve this problem. The algorithm here requires a trick as follows:   
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
Finding the parity of $n$ numbers is in $\TC_0$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First we need to construct a threshold function. 
\end{proof}

\section{$\AC_0$}
\begin{theorem}
The addition of two $n$ bit numbers is in $\AC_0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}
\emph{Note: } as it turns out the class $\AC_0$ is exactly the set of all first order formulas!
